+## THE NEED FOR HELP FROM COMMUNITY
+
+Sorry for bothering you with my personal problems, but I need a help
+from community.
+
+I'm a Russian citizen. Due to sanctions, it seems I've lost control
+over my domain, ***apevzner.com***
+
+As result, I've also lost access to my primary e-mail address,
+mailto:pzz@apevzner.com, under which I'm known to the open source
+community.
+
+My e-mail is hosted by Google Workspace and my domain was registered
+at GoDaddy via Google. Currently I have no way to pay for my domain,
+so my domain was expired.
+
+After long conversation with Google I was able to switch my Workspace
+account to the "free plan", available for people who use the account for
+personal purposes only, thanks Google for that!
+
+But now my DNS console is not accessible, so I can't initiate domain
+transfer to some local registrant. And in the same time, e-mail/chat
+technical support from Workspace team also is not available, as it is
+not included into the "free plan". And without human technical support
+my problem seems unsolvable.
+
+I'm the author and I manage two important packages, `sane-airscan` (this
+one) and `ipp-usb`. These packages included into all major Linux
+distros. Also, Google ChromeOS uses my `sane-airscan` for scanning and
+their IPP over USB implementation was greatly inspired my `ipp-usb`.
+
+My connection to the open source community was always done via
+pzz@gmail.com e-mail address. But now it doesn't work, so I'm in the
+isolation.
+
+If somebody from Google or GoDaddy can read it, please, help!
+
+For now, my backup e-mail address is mailto:apevzner@gmail.com
+
+### About
+
 Similar to how most modern network printers support "driverless" printing,
 using the universal vendor-neutral printing protocol, many modern network
 scanners and MFPs support "driverless" scanning.
