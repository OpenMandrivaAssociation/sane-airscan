+.TH "SANE\-AIRSCAN" "5" "May 2022" "" "AirScan (eSCL) and WSD SANE backend"
 .SH "NAME"
 \fBsane\-airscan\fR \- SANE backend for AirScan (eSCL) and WSD scanners and MFP
-.
 .SH "DESCRIPTION"
 The \fBsane\-airscan\fR is the universal backend for "driverless" document scanning\. Currently it supports two protocols:
-.
 .IP "" 4
-.
 .nf
-
 1\. eSCL, also known as AirScan or AirPrint scan
 2\. WSD, also known as WS\-Scan
-.
 .fi
-.
 .IP "" 0
-.
 .SH "CONFIGURATION"
 The sane\-airscan loads its configuration files from the following places:
-.
 .IP "" 4
-.
 .nf
-
 1\. /etc/sane\.d/airscan\.conf
 2\. /etc/sane\.d/airscan\.d/*
-.
 .fi
-.
 .IP "" 0
-.
 .P
 The configuration file syntax is very similar to the \.INI file syntax\. It consist of sections, each section contains some variables\. Comments are started from # or ; characters and continies until end of line
-.
 .IP "" 4
-.
 .nf
-
 # This is a comment
 [section 1]
 variable 1 = value 1  ; and another comment
 variable 2 = value 2
-.
 .fi
-.
 .IP "" 0
-.
 .P
 Leading and trailing spaces of variable name and value are striped\. If you want to preserve them, put name or value into quotes ("like this")\.
-.
 .SH "CONFIGURATION OF DEVICES"
 If scanner and computer are connected to the same LAN segment, everything expected to "just work" out of box, without any need of manual configuration\.
-.
 .P
 However, in some cases manual configuration can be useful\. For example:
-.
 .IP "" 4
-.
 .nf
-
 1\. If computer and scanner are connected via IP router
 2\. There are a lot of devices on a corporate network, but
    only few of them are interesting
 3\. Automatic discovery works unreliable
-.
 .fi
-.
 .IP "" 0
-.
 .P
 To manually configure a device, add the following section to the configuration file:
-.
 .IP "" 4
-.
 .nf
-
 [devices]
 "Kyocera eSCL" = http://192\.168\.1\.102:9095/eSCL, eSCL
 "Kyocera WSD" = http://192\.168\.1\.102:5358/WSDScanner, WSD
 "Device I do not want to see" = disable
-.
 .fi
-.
 .IP "" 0
-.
 .P
 The \fB[devices]\fR section contains all manually configured devices, one line per device, and each line contains a device name on a left side of equation and device URL on a rights side, followed by protocol (eSCL or WSD)\. If protocol is omitted, eSCL is assumed\. You may also disable particular device by using the \fBdisable\fR keyword instead of URL\.
-.
 .P
 In addition, you can manually configure a device by directly passing its URL in a device name without adding it to the configuration file\. This takes the format \fBprotocol:Device Name:URL\fR\. The examples above could be written as \fBescl:Kyocera eSCL:http://192\.168\.1\.102:9095/eSCL\fR and \fBwsd:Kyocera WSD:http://192\.168\.1\.102:5358/WSDScanner\fR\.
-.
 .P
-To figure out URLs of available devices, the simplest way is to run a supplied \fBairscan\-discover\fR tool on a computer connected with scanner to the same LAN segment\. On success, this program will dump to its standard output a list of discovered devices in a format suitable for inclusion into the configuration file\.

On success, this program will dump to its standard output a list of discovered devices in a format suitable for inclusion into the configuration file\.
 .P
-If running \fBairscan\-discover\fR on same LAN segment as a scanner is not possible, you will have to follow a hard way\. Your administrator must know device IP address, consult your device manual for the eSCL port, and the URL path component most likely is the "/eSCL", though on some devices it may differ\. Discovering WSD URLs doing this way is much harder, because it is very difficult to guess TCP port and URL path, that in a case of eSCL\.

Discovering WSD URLs doing this way is much harder, because it is very difficult to guess TCP port and URL path, that in a case of eSCL\.
 .P
 For eSCL devices, the URL can also use the unix:// scheme, such as unix://scanner\.sock/eSCL\. The "host" from the URL is a file name that will be searched for in the directory specified by socket_dir (see below)\. When connecting to the scanner, all traffic will be sent to the specified UNIX socket instead of a TCP connection\.

 Network names come from DNS\-SD, WS\-Discovery doesn\'t provide this information\. For filtering by network name to work, Avahi must be enabled and device must be discoverable via DNS\-SD (not necessarily as a scanner, it\'s enough if WSD scanner is discoverable as a printer via DNS\-SD)\.
